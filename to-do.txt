1) Fix read so it takes multiple lines, not just two DONE
2) Read RFC on POST
3) Implement POST:
	a) Is command POST? If not, return 400 Bad Request or 501 Not Implemented
	b) Is the file a CGI file? If not, return 405 Method Not Allowed
	c) Does the CGI script have execute permissions? If not, return 403 Forbidden
	d) Check headers. Does Content-Type exist and is it x-www-form-urlencoded? If not, return 500 Internal Server Error.
	e) Does Content-Length exist and is it a non-negative integer? If not, return 411 Length Required.
	f) If command is POST, file exists, file is CGI, file has execute permissions, and header has valid content-type and content-length headers, then:

		1) Grab the body of the request and decode it
		2) Spawn a new process
		3) Set CONTENT_LENGTH environment variable to length of decoded payload
		4) Set other environmental variables as needed
		5) Run CGI Script
		6) Send environment variables to CGI script via STDIN
		7) Redirect output of script via STDOUT to some response
		8) If response is empty, return 204 No Content
		9) Otherwise, return result of script as a text/html response
